# Simple Life Tracker
Simple life tracker is an android app in development made by me for my android class.   
The app is used to track life for Magic the Gathering and is very useful   
for when playing the game at a friends or when playing at your LGS.

- Incrementing and decrementing buttons help a player change the display for their life total.
- Reset button resets each life total to 40, and clears winning player display
- When 3 players are out of the game, the winning player is displayed.
- If the winning player is dispayed and then changes are made so there isn't a winning player   
  anymore, the winning player display will clear.
